### Dealing with deadlock sessions in a database involves identifying and terminating the sessions causing the deadlock. Here's how you can do it for both MySQL and PostgreSQL.

### MySQL

In MySQL, deadlocks can be detected using the `SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS` command. You can then identify the session causing the deadlock and kill it.

1. **Identify the Deadlock:**

   Run the following command to check for deadlocks:
   ```sql
   SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS;
   ```

   This will display the InnoDB status, including information about any deadlocks.

2. **Identify the Blocking Session:**

   Find the transaction ID of the blocked transaction from the output of the previous command.

3. **Kill the Blocking Session:**

   Use the `KILL` command to terminate the session causing the deadlock:
   ```sql
   KILL <session_id>;
   ```

   Replace `<session_id>` with the actual session ID obtained from the previous step.

### PostgreSQL

In PostgreSQL, you can use system views to identify and terminate the sessions causing the deadlock.

1. **Identify the Deadlock:**

   Run the following query to get information about blocked and blocking sessions:
   ```sql
   SELECT
     blocked_locks.pid AS blocked_pid,
     blocked_activity.usename AS blocked_user,
     blocking_locks.pid AS blocking_pid,
     blocking_activity.usename AS blocking_user,
     blocked_activity.query AS blocked_query,
     blocking_activity.query AS current_query
   FROM pg_locks blocked_locks
   JOIN pg_stat_activity blocked_activity ON blocked_activity.pid = blocked_locks.pid
   JOIN pg_locks blocking_locks ON blocking_locks.locktype = blocked_locks.locktype
     AND blocking_locks.DATABASE IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.DATABASE
     AND blocking_locks.relation IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.relation
     AND blocking_locks.page IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.page
     AND blocking_locks.tuple IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.tuple
     AND blocking_locks.virtualxid IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.virtualxid
     AND blocking_locks.transactionid IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.transactionid
     AND blocking_locks.classid IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.classid
     AND blocking_locks.objid IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.objid
     AND blocking_locks.objsubid IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.objsubid
   JOIN pg_stat_activity blocking_activity ON blocking_activity.pid = blocking_locks.pid
   WHERE NOT blocked_locks.granted;
   ```

   This will give you a list of blocked and blocking sessions.

2. **Terminate the Blocking Session:**

   Use the `pg_terminate_backend` function to terminate the blocking session:
   ```sql
   SELECT pg_terminate_backend(<blocking_pid>);
   ```

   Replace `<blocking_pid>` with the process ID of the blocking session obtained from the previous query.

### Summary

1. **MySQL:**
   - Use `SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS` to identify deadlocks.
   - Find and kill the blocking session using the `KILL` command.

2. **PostgreSQL:**
   - Use system views to identify blocked and blocking sessions.
   - Terminate the blocking session using the `pg_terminate_backend` function.

### Example

Hereâ€™s a practical example for each:

**MySQL Example:**

```sql
SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS;
-- Assume the output indicates session 1234 is causing a deadlock
KILL 1234;
```

**PostgreSQL Example:**

```sql
SELECT
  blocked_locks.pid AS blocked_pid,
  blocked_activity.usename AS blocked_user,
  blocking_locks.pid AS blocking_pid,
  blocking_activity.usename AS blocking_user,
  blocked_activity.query AS blocked_query,
  blocking_activity.query AS current_query
FROM pg_locks blocked_locks
JOIN pg_stat_activity blocked_activity ON blocked_activity.pid = blocked_locks.pid
JOIN pg_locks blocking_locks ON blocking_locks.locktype = blocked_locks.locktype
  AND blocking_locks.DATABASE IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.DATABASE
  AND blocking_locks.relation IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.relation
  AND blocking_locks.page IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.page
  AND blocking_locks.tuple IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.tuple
  AND blocking_locks.virtualxid IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.virtualxid
  AND blocking_locks.transactionid IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.transactionid
  AND blocking_locks.classid IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.classid
  AND blocking_locks.objid IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.objid
  AND blocking_locks.objsubid IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.objsubid
JOIN pg_stat_activity blocking_activity ON blocking_activity.pid = blocking_locks.pid
WHERE NOT blocked_locks.granted;

-- Assume the output indicates process 5678 is the blocking PID
SELECT pg_terminate_backend(5678);
```
