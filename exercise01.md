Integrating data from SQL Server and MongoDB into Snowflake and performing analyses on this data involves several steps. Here's a high-level overview of the process:

1. **Data Extraction:**
   - Extract data from SQL Server.
   - Extract data from MongoDB.

2. **Data Loading:**
   - Load the extracted data into Snowflake.

3. **Data Transformation:**
   - Transform the data as necessary for analysis.

4. **Analysis:**
   - Perform the required analyses.

### Step 1: Data Extraction

#### Extracting Data from SQL Server
You can use SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS), Azure Data Factory (ADF), or other ETL tools to extract data from SQL Server.

Example using Python and `pyodbc`:
```python
import pyodbc
import pandas as pd

# Define connection details
conn = pyodbc.connect('DRIVER={SQL Server};SERVER=your_server;DATABASE=your_db;UID=your_username;PWD=your_password')

# Query data
sql_query = "SELECT * FROM your_table"
df_sql = pd.read_sql(sql_query, conn)

# Close the connection
conn.close()
```

#### Extracting Data from MongoDB
You can use Python with `pymongo` to extract data from MongoDB.

Example using Python and `pymongo`:
```python
from pymongo import MongoClient
import pandas as pd

# Define connection details
client = MongoClient('mongodb://your_username:your_password@your_server:your_port')
db = client.your_database
collection = db.your_collection

# Query data
cursor = collection.find()
df_mongo = pd.DataFrame(list(cursor))

# Close the connection
client.close()
```

### Step 2: Data Loading

Load the extracted data into Snowflake. You can use the Snowflake Python connector or other ETL tools like Talend, Informatica, or Matillion.

Example using Python and Snowflake connector:
```python
import snowflake.connector
import pandas as pd

# Define connection details
conn = snowflake.connector.connect(
    user='your_username',
    password='your_password',
    account='your_account'
)

# Define cursor
cur = conn.cursor()

# Create or use existing database/schema
cur.execute("USE DATABASE your_database")
cur.execute("USE SCHEMA your_schema")

# Load data from SQL Server into Snowflake
df_sql.to_sql('sql_table', conn, if_exists='replace', index=False)

# Load data from MongoDB into Snowflake
df_mongo.to_sql('mongo_table', conn, if_exists='replace', index=False)

# Close the connection
conn.close()
```

### Step 3: Data Transformation

Perform necessary data transformations in Snowflake using SQL. You can use Snowflake's capabilities to create views, tables, or perform SQL operations.

Example:
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE combined_data AS
SELECT
    a.*,
    b.*
FROM
    sql_table a
JOIN
    mongo_table b
ON
    a.id = b.id;
```

### Step 4: Analysis

Perform the crucial analyses on the integrated data. Here are three common types of analysis for a web commerce application:

1. **Sales Performance Analysis:**
   - Analyze sales trends, revenue, and profitability.
   ```sql
   SELECT
       DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date) AS month,
       SUM(sales_amount) AS total_sales,
       COUNT(order_id) AS total_orders
   FROM
       combined_data
   GROUP BY
       month
   ORDER BY
       month;
   ```

2. **Customer Behavior Analysis:**
   - Analyze customer purchasing patterns and behaviors.
   ```sql
   SELECT
       customer_id,
       COUNT(order_id) AS total_orders,
       SUM(sales_amount) AS total_spent,
       AVG(sales_amount) AS avg_order_value
   FROM
       combined_data
   GROUP BY
       customer_id
   ORDER BY
       total_spent DESC
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

3. **Product Performance Analysis:**
   - Analyze the performance of different products.
   ```sql
   SELECT
       product_id,
       SUM(sales_amount) AS total_sales,
       COUNT(order_id) AS total_orders
   FROM
       combined_data
   GROUP BY
       product_id
   ORDER BY
       total_sales DESC
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

### Summary

1. **Extract** data from SQL Server and MongoDB.
2. **Load** the data into Snowflake.
3. **Transform** the data as needed.
4. **Analyze** the integrated data to derive insights.

By following these steps, you can successfully integrate and analyze data from different sources in Snowflake for a web commerce application.
