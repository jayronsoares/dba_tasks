### 1. **Provisioned Throughput**

**What It Is**: Provisioned throughput refers to the capacity that you explicitly set for read and write operations for your database. This is typically more relevant for services like DynamoDB, where you specify the number of reads and writes per second.

**How to Use**:
- **DynamoDB Example**:
  ```sh
  aws dynamodb update-table --table-name MyTable --provisioned-throughput ReadCapacityUnits=5,WriteCapacityUnits=5
  ```

**When to Use**: Use provisioned throughput when you need predictable performance and can estimate your workload requirements. It's crucial for applications with consistent, high-demand traffic.

### 2. **RDS Proxy**

**What It Is**: RDS Proxy is a fully managed, highly available database proxy that helps improve application scalability, availability, and security by pooling and sharing database connections.

**How to Use**:
- Enable RDS Proxy via the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI.
  ```sh
  aws rds create-db-proxy \
    --db-proxy-name my-db-proxy \
    --engine-family MYSQL \
    --auth '["{ \"SecretArn\": \"my-secret-arn\", \"IAMAuth\": \"DISABLED\" }"]' \
    --role-arn my-role-arn \
    --vpc-subnet-ids subnet-1 subnet-2
  ```

**When to Use**: Use RDS Proxy to manage database connections efficiently for applications that require many simultaneous connections, such as serverless applications or microservices architectures.

### 3. **Database Instance**

**What It Is**: A database instance is a standalone database environment in AWS, which can be either RDS (for MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.) or Amazon DocumentDB (for MongoDB).

**How to Use**:
- Create a database instance via the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI.
  ```sh
  aws rds create-db-instance \
    --db-instance-identifier mydbinstance \
    --db-instance-class db.m5.large \
    --engine mysql \
    --master-username admin \
    --master-user-password password \
    --allocated-storage 20
  ```

**When to Use**: Use a database instance when you need a managed database environment with built-in features like backups, monitoring, and scaling.

### 4. **Provisioned IOPS**

**What It Is**: Provisioned IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second) provides fast, predictable, and consistent I/O performance for your database instances.

**How to Use**:
- Specify the desired IOPS when creating or modifying an RDS instance.
  ```sh
  aws rds create-db-instance \
    --db-instance-identifier mydbinstance \
    --db-instance-class db.m5.large \
    --engine mysql \
    --master-username admin \
    --master-user-password password \
    --allocated-storage 20 \
    --iops 1000
  ```

**When to Use**: Use Provisioned IOPS for I/O-intensive workloads requiring low-latency performance, such as large OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) systems.

### 5. **Database Storage**

**What It Is**: Database storage refers to the disk storage allocated to your database instance. This includes general-purpose SSD, Provisioned IOPS SSD, and magnetic storage.

**How to Use**:
- Choose the storage type and allocate the desired amount of storage when creating or modifying a database instance.
  ```sh
  aws rds create-db-instance \
    --db-instance-identifier mydbinstance \
    --db-instance-class db.m5.large \
    --engine mysql \
    --master-username admin \
    --master-user-password password \
    --allocated-storage 20
  ```

**When to Use**: Select the appropriate storage type based on performance and cost requirements. Use General Purpose SSD for balanced performance and cost, Provisioned IOPS SSD for high performance, and magnetic storage for cost-effective storage with less performance needs.

### 6. **Serverless**

**What It Is**: Serverless databases, like Aurora Serverless, automatically scale the compute capacity based on your applicationâ€™s needs without managing the underlying infrastructure.

**How to Use**:
- Create a serverless database instance via the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI.
  ```sh
  aws rds create-db-cluster \
    --db-cluster-identifier my-aurora-serverless-cluster \
    --engine aurora \
    --scaling-configuration MinCapacity=2,MaxCapacity=16,AutoPause=true,SecondsUntilAutoPause=300
  ```

**When to Use**: Use serverless databases for unpredictable workloads or when you want to minimize the management of database infrastructure, such as development, testing, and new applications with variable workloads.

### 7. **Aurora Global Database**

**What It Is**: Aurora Global Database is a single Aurora database that spans multiple AWS regions, enabling low-latency global reads and fast disaster recovery.

**How to Use**:
- Create a global database via the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI.
  ```sh
  aws rds create-global-cluster \
    --global-cluster-identifier my-global-cluster \
    --source-db-cluster-identifier arn:aws:rds:us-east-1:123456789012:cluster:my-cluster
  ```

**When to Use**: Use Aurora Global Database for applications that require low-latency access to data across different regions or need high availability and disaster recovery capabilities across regions.

### 8. **Performance Insights**

**What It Is**: Performance Insights is an advanced database monitoring feature that helps you visualize and understand database performance.

**How to Use**:
- Enable Performance Insights when creating or modifying a database instance.
  ```sh
  aws rds modify-db-instance \
    --db-instance-identifier mydbinstance \
    --enable-performance-insights
  ```

**When to Use**: Use Performance Insights to monitor database performance, identify bottlenecks, and optimize queries and workloads. It's especially useful for diagnosing performance issues.

### 9. **Storage Snapshot**

**What It Is**: A storage snapshot is a point-in-time copy of your database, allowing you to back up and restore your data.

**How to Use**:
- Create a snapshot via the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI.
  ```sh
  aws rds create-db-snapshot \
    --db-snapshot-identifier mydbsnapshot \
    --db-instance-identifier mydbinstance
  ```

**When to Use**: Use snapshots for data protection, disaster recovery, and creating copies of your database for testing and development.

### 10. **System Operation CPU Credits**

**What It Is**: CPU credits are used by T2 and T3 instance types to provide a baseline level of CPU performance with the ability to burst above the baseline.

**How to Use**:
- Monitor CPU credit usage via CloudWatch to ensure your instance has enough credits to handle its workload.
  ```sh
  aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics \
    --metric-name CPUCreditBalance \
    --start-time 2022-01-01T00:00:00Z \
    --end-time 2022-01-01T23:59:59Z \
    --period 300 \
    --namespace AWS/EC2 \
    --statistics Average \
    --dimensions Name=InstanceId,Value=i-1234567890abcdef0
  ```

**When to Use**: Use T2 and T3 instances for workloads that require baseline CPU performance with occasional bursts, such as development environments, small web servers, and low-traffic applications.
