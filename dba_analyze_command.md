### Tables in need of the `ANALYZE TABLE` command

### 1. Identifying Recently Updated Tables
This script identifies tables that have been recently updated.

```sql
SELECT table_schema, table_name, update_time
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'your_database_name'
  AND update_time IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY update_time DESC
LIMIT 10; -- Limit to top 10 tables based on recent updates
```

### 2. Identifying Tables with High Insert/Update/Delete Activity
This script identifies tables with high activity in terms of inserts, updates, and deletes.

```sql
SELECT table_schema, table_name, table_rows, auto_increment
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'your_database_name'
  AND auto_increment IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY auto_increment DESC
LIMIT 10; -- Limit to top 10 tables based on high activity
```

### 3. Checking Tables with High Index Usage
This script identifies tables with high index usage which might benefit from updated statistics.

```sql
SELECT table_schema, table_name, index_length
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'your_database_name'
  AND index_length > 0
ORDER BY index_length DESC
LIMIT 10; -- Limit to top 10 tables based on high index usage
```

### 4. Identifying Tables with High Read/Write Latency
This script checks for tables with high read/write latency.

```sql
SELECT table_schema, table_name, AVG_TIMER_WAIT AS avg_latency
FROM performance_schema.table_io_waits_summary_by_table
WHERE object_schema = 'your_database_name'
ORDER BY avg_latency DESC
LIMIT 10; -- Limit to top 10 tables based on read/write latency
```

### 5. Ensuring Table Size and Growth
This script ensures that the size and growth of the tables are considered before running `ANALYZE TABLE`.

```sql
SELECT table_schema, table_name, data_length + index_length AS total_size, table_rows
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'your_database_name'
  AND (data_length + index_length) > 10000000 -- Size threshold (e.g., 10 MB)
ORDER BY total_size DESC
LIMIT 10; -- Limit to top 10 largest tables
```

### Comprehensive Script to Generate `ANALYZE TABLE` Commands

Combining the above checks, here is a comprehensive script that generates `ANALYZE TABLE` commands for tables meeting multiple criteria:

```sql
WITH high_activity_tables AS (
    SELECT table_schema, table_name, MAX(update_time) AS last_update_time
    FROM information_schema.tables
    WHERE table_schema = 'your_database_name'
      AND update_time IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY table_schema, table_name
),
high_index_usage_tables AS (
    SELECT table_schema, table_name
    FROM information_schema.tables
    WHERE table_schema = 'your_database_name'
      AND index_length > 0
),
high_latency_tables AS (
    SELECT object_schema AS table_schema, object_name AS table_name
    FROM performance_schema.table_io_waits_summary_by_table
    WHERE object_schema = 'your_database_name'
    ORDER BY AVG_TIMER_WAIT DESC
    LIMIT 10
),
large_tables AS (
    SELECT table_schema, table_name
    FROM information_schema.tables
    WHERE table_schema = 'your_database_name'
      AND (data_length + index_length) > 10000000 -- Size threshold (e.g., 10 MB)
)
SELECT DISTINCT table_schema, table_name
FROM high_activity_tables
UNION
SELECT DISTINCT table_schema, table_name
FROM high_index_usage_tables
UNION
SELECT DISTINCT table_schema, table_name
FROM high_latency_tables
UNION
SELECT DISTINCT table_schema, table_name
FROM large_tables
ORDER BY table_schema, table_name;

-- Generating ANALYZE TABLE commands for identified tables
SELECT CONCAT('ANALYZE TABLE ', table_schema, '.', table_name, ';')
FROM (
    SELECT DISTINCT table_schema, table_name
    FROM high_activity_tables
    UNION
    SELECT DISTINCT table_schema, table_name
    FROM high_index_usage_tables
    UNION
    SELECT DISTINCT table_schema, table_name
    FROM high_latency_tables
    UNION
    SELECT DISTINCT table_schema, table_name
    FROM large_tables
) AS tables_to_analyze
ORDER BY table_schema, table_name;
```
-------------------------------

1. **Identify Tables with High Update Rate**:
   - This script identifies tables with a high rate of updates, which typically indicates the need for reanalyzing.

   ```sql
   SELECT table_schema, table_name, update_time
   FROM information_schema.tables
   WHERE table_schema = 'your_database_name'
     AND update_time IS NOT NULL
   ORDER BY update_time DESC
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

2. **Check for Tables with Significant Data Changes**:
   - This script checks for tables that have had a significant number of inserts, updates, or deletes.

   ```sql
   SELECT table_schema, table_name, table_rows, update_time
   FROM information_schema.tables
   WHERE table_schema = 'your_database_name'
     AND update_time IS NOT NULL
     AND (table_rows > 1000000) -- Threshold for significant data changes
   ORDER BY update_time DESC;
   ```

3. **Identify Tables with Stale Statistics**:
   - This script identifies tables with statistics that haven't been updated for a while.

   ```sql
   SELECT table_schema, table_name, update_time, TIMESTAMPDIFF(DAY, update_time, NOW()) AS days_since_last_update
   FROM information_schema.tables
   WHERE table_schema = 'your_database_name'
     AND update_time IS NOT NULL
     AND TIMESTAMPDIFF(DAY, update_time, NOW()) > 7 -- Threshold for stale statistics
   ORDER BY update_time DESC;
   ```

4. **Identify Tables with High Query Execution Time**:
   - This script identifies tables involved in slow queries, indicating a potential need for reanalyzing.

   ```sql
   SELECT t.table_schema, t.table_name, COUNT(*) AS slow_queries
   FROM information_schema.tables t
   JOIN performance_schema.events_statements_history e
     ON t.table_name = e.object_name
   WHERE t.table_schema = 'your_database_name'
     AND e.TIMER_WAIT > 1000000000 -- Threshold for slow queries (1 second)
   GROUP BY t.table_schema, t.table_name
   ORDER BY slow_queries DESC
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

5. **Identify Tables with High Index Usage**:
   - This script identifies tables with high index usage, which might benefit from updated statistics.

   ```sql
   SELECT t.table_schema, t.table_name, s.index_name, s.user_seeks, s.user_scans, s.user_lookups
   FROM information_schema.tables t
   JOIN performance_schema.table_io_waits_summary_by_index_usage s
     ON t.table_schema = s.object_schema
     AND t.table_name = s.object_name
   WHERE t.table_schema = 'your_database_name'
     AND s.index_name IS NOT NULL
     AND (s.user_seeks + s.user_scans + s.user_lookups) > 10000 -- Threshold for high index usage
   ORDER BY (s.user_seeks + s.user_scans + s.user_lookups) DESC;
   ```

### Combining Results for `ANALYZE TABLE`

After identifying the tables that need analyzing using the above scripts, you can generate the `ANALYZE TABLE` commands. Here is an example of how to combine the results:

```sql
-- Generate the ANALYZE TABLE commands for identified tables
SELECT CONCAT('ANALYZE TABLE ', table_schema, '.', table_name, ';') AS analyze_command
FROM (
    SELECT table_schema, table_name
    FROM information_schema.tables
    WHERE table_schema = 'your_database_name'
      AND update_time IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY update_time DESC
    LIMIT 10
    
    UNION
    
    SELECT table_schema, table_name
    FROM information_schema.tables
    WHERE table_schema = 'your_database_name'
      AND update_time IS NOT NULL
      AND (table_rows > 1000000)
    ORDER BY update_time DESC
    
    UNION
    
    SELECT table_schema, table_name
    FROM information_schema.tables
    WHERE table_schema = 'your_database_name'
      AND update_time IS NOT NULL
      AND TIMESTAMPDIFF(DAY, update_time, NOW()) > 7
    ORDER BY update_time DESC
    
    UNION
    
    SELECT t.table_schema, t.table_name
    FROM information_schema.tables t
    JOIN performance_schema.events_statements_history e
      ON t.table_name = e.object_name
    WHERE t.table_schema = 'your_database_name'
      AND e.TIMER_WAIT > 1000000000
    GROUP BY t.table_schema, t.table_name
    ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
    LIMIT 10
    
    UNION
    
    SELECT t.table_schema, t.table_name
    FROM information_schema.tables t
    JOIN performance_schema.table_io_waits_summary_by_index_usage s
      ON t.table_schema = s.object_schema
      AND t.table_name = s.object_name
    WHERE t.table_schema = 'your_database_name'
      AND s.index_name IS NOT NULL
      AND (s.user_seeks + s.user_scans + s.user_lookups) > 10000
    ORDER BY (s.user_seeks + s.user_scans + s.user_lookups) DESC
) AS identified_tables;
```

This combined query ensures you are targeting the right tables for the `ANALYZE TABLE` command based on multiple advanced checks, thus optimizing the performance and maintaining the efficiency of your AWS Aurora MySQL database without incurring unnecessary charges.
